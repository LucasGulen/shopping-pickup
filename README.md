The aim of this project was to create a mobile application that could be useful in the COVID-19 period.

The objective was to build an Ionic application that could help persons at risk who may need some help, such as IT troubleshooting and buy some food.

We achieved to build the front part and simulate a database to make a proof of work.

To make this application work in DEV environnement, we use NPM as a package manager and Ionic 5.0.7 as the front framework. To make this project work you can download this repository, download and install Node.js, and execute *npm install* in the repository directory you've just downloaded.


This project was made with collaboration of Flavio Barreiro Lindo, Alex Perritaz, Lo√Øc Schupbach and David Roch as part of our Master in Information Science.
