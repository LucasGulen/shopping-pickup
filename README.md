The aim of this project was to create a mobile application that could be useful in the COVID-19 period.

The objective was to build an Ionic application that could help persons at risk who may need some help, such as IT troubleshooting and buy some food.

We achieved to build the front part and simulate a database to make a proof of work.

To make this application work in DEV environnement, we use NPM as a package manager and Ionic 5.0.7 as the front framework.

To make this project work you will need :

- Node.js
- Ionic version 5.0.7

First, you need to download and install Node.js and then execute the command *npm install -g ionic@5.0.7* in the Node.js command prompt.

Then you need to download this repository, open the Node.js command prompt and use the *cd* command to be in the directory of this repository you've just downloaded. Finally, execute the command *npm install* to install all necessary packages we used for this project. 

Other commands you will need for this ionic application can be found on https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli.

This project was made with collaboration of Flavio Barreiro Lindo, Alex Perritaz, Lo√Øc Schupbach and David Roch as part of our Master in Information Science.
